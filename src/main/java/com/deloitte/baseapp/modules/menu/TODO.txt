Menu Feature:
TODO:
 - Try to understand:
    - How @CSVBindByName works --> checked
    - Understand how Reddis work --> done halfway
    - Storing cache at Reddis or LocalStorage --> checked
    - How @Cacheable annotation works

TODO:
    - What I can do currently:
        1) Hard code a set of menu values in DB
        2) fetch to front-end with an API Call upon logging in --> maybe we can enable a menu refresh feature?
        3) Store the menu at localstorage
        4) Change the value in DB
        5) Check if value in DB changes (supposedly won't change)
        6) Logout and login again:



 TODO:
  - Need to figure out how to design our DTO
   -Why is this so?
    - Because we need to send the parent menu together with their children in a structured manner s
    - such that parent contains children and children contain children --> dynamically
    - Note that it can also be separated because we can send and assemble the information from the front-end.
